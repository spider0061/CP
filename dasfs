/*
  1. always check for unintialized vector.
 
  2. priority_queue<pair<int,int>,vector<pair<int,int>>,greater<pair<int,int>> > pq; for djikstra
 
  3. check for constrained properly
 
  4. 10^8 operations per second
 
  5. Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
 
  6. odd number can be expresses in sum of two prime number only if (n-2) is prime.
 
  If n = 12, the time complexity can be O(n!).
  If n = 25, the time complexity can be O(2n).
  If n = 100, the time complexity can be O(n4).
  If n = 500, the time complexity can be O(n3).
  If n = 10^4, the time complexity can be O(n2).
  If n = 10^6, the time complexity can be O(n log n).
  If n = 10^8, the time complexity can be O(n).
  If n > 10^8, the time complexity can be O(log n) or O(1).
